        <p>‍</p>
        <p>These terms and conditions (these “Terms”) constitute a binding legal agreement between each individual, entity, group or association (“Users”, “You”) who views, interacts, links to or otherwise uses or derives any benefit from the <strong>“</strong>
          <a href="http://qacc.giveth.io"><strong>qacc.giveth.io</strong></a><strong>”, “</strong>
          <a href="http://q-acc.giveth.io/%E2%80%9D"><strong>q-acc.giveth.io/”</strong></a><strong>, “</strong>
          <a href="http://q-acc.giveth.io/create%E2%80%9D"><strong>q-acc.giveth.io/create”</strong></a><strong>, “</strong>
          <a href="http://q-acc.giveth.io/kyc%E2%80%9D"><strong>q-acc.giveth.io/kyc”</strong></a><strong>, “qacc.xyz”,</strong> all related subdomains (the “Site”, “Website” or the “Interface”) (as defined below) and Quadratic Accelerator Inc (the owner/operator of the Site) and each of its successors and assigns (the “Site Operator”, “Accelerator”,  “We”, “Our” or “Us”).
        </p>
        <p>The Interface provides access to a permissionless protocol (“Protocol”) on the public and distributed blockchain Polygon (the “Blockchain”), that allows users to transact using smart contracts (“Smart Contracts”). The Interface is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol.</p>
        <p>Please read these Terms carefully before using the Interface. These Terms apply to any person accessing the Interface and by using the Interface you agree to be bound by them. If you do not want to be bound by them, you should not access the Interface. By using the Interface in any capacity, you agree that you have read and understood these Terms.</p>
        <p>Please read these Terms carefully to ensure that you understand each provision. This agreement contains a mandatory individual arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>2. Modification of the Terms</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement from time to time. If we make any modifications, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of the Agreement and by maintaining a current version of the Agreement at <a href="https://giveth.notion.site/q-acc-Round-Terms-and-Conditions-10a3ab28d48c8058af3cd37455b591c5">https://giveth.notion.site/q-acc-Round-Terms-and-Conditions-10a3ab28d48c8058af3cd37455b591c5</a> . You accept that by doing so, we provide you with sufficient notice of such change.</p>
        <p>All modifications will be effective when they are posted, and your continued accessing or use of the Interface will serve as confirmation of your acceptance of those modifications. If you do not agree with any modifications to this Agreement, you must immediately stop accessing and using the Interface.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>3. Eligibility</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>By accessing and using our Interface you represent and warrant to us that:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>You are at least 18 years old, or the legal age in your jurisdiction, with no legal impediment or incapability, capable of using the services and participating in any token distribution.</li>
          <li>You have read and understood the risks of using the Interface, and that you are solely responsible for your actions.</li>
          <li>You are acting on your own account as principal and not as trustee, agent or otherwise on behalf of any other persons or entities.</li>
          <li>You have had the opportunity to take legal, financial, accounting or other advice that you deem appropriate prior to using the Interface.</li>
          <li>You will only use the Interface with legally obtained digital assets that belong to you, and with full legal and beneficial title to any such assets.</li>
          <li>Your access to the Interface and the underlying Protocol may be restricted based on your jurisdiction or geographical location. You must not use the Interface and the underlying Protocol if you are located in or a citizen or resident of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction in which use of the access to the Interface or the use of the Protocol would be illegal or otherwise violate any applicable law (a “Restricted Territory”). We reserve the right to restrict access to any Restricted Territory and may implement technical controls to prevent access to the Interface or the Protocol from any Restricted Territory, including, but not limited to, <strong>Afghanistan, American Samoa, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Belarus, Bosnia Herzegovina, Central African Republic, Cuba, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Fiji, Guam, Hong Kong, Iran, Iraq, Kosovo, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Montenegro, Myanmar, Nicaragua, North Korea, North Macedonia, Palau, Panama, Russia, Samoa, Serbia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, US Virgin Islands, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Yemen,</strong> or any jurisdictions in which the sale of cryptocurrencies are prohibited, restricted or unauthorized in any form or manner whether in full or in part under the laws, regulatory requirements or rules in such jurisdiction; or any state, country, or region that is subject to sanctions enforced by the United States, such as the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (“SDN List”) and Consolidated Sanctions List (“Non-SDN Lists”), the United Kingdom, or the European Union (collectively, “Restricted Territories”);</li>
          <li>You are not a resident of any restricted territory and have not used any technical means including any virtual private network (VPN) or other means to disguise or manipulate your geographical location to access the Services from a restricted territory; and</li>
          <li>You represent that your access and use of the Services will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and that you will not access or use the Services to conduct, promote, or otherwise facilitate any illegal activity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>4. Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>The Website may directly or indirectly collect and temporarily store personally identifiable information for operational purposes, including for the purpose of identifying blockchain addresses or IP addresses that may indicate use of the Site from prohibited jurisdictions or by sanctioned persons or other Prohibited Uses. From time to time, we do, however, use third-party service providers, like Google Analytics, which may receive or independently obtain your personal information from publicly-available sources. We do not control how these third parties handle your data and you should review their privacy policies to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information. By accessing and using the Interface, you understand and consent to our Privacy Policy: <a href="https://qacc.giveth.io/privacy-policy">https://qacc.giveth.io/privacy-policy</a>.</p>
        <p>We use the information we collect to detect, prevent, and mitigate financial crime and other illicit or harmful activities on the Interface. For these purposes, we may share the information we collect with blockchain analytics providers. We share information with these service providers only so that they can help us promote the safety, security, and integrity of the Interface. We do not retain the information we collect any longer than necessary for these purposes.</p>
        <p>Please note that when you use the Interface, you are interacting with the Blockchain, which provides transparency into your transactions. Accelerator does not control and is not responsible for any information you make public on the Blockchain by taking actions through the Interface.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>5. Access to the Protocol</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>The Interface provides access to the Protocol on the Blockchain. The Interface is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. You understand and acknowledge that we do not broker trading orders on your behalf. We also do not facilitate the execution or settlement of your trades, which occur entirely on the Blockchain.</p>
        <p>The Interface is a purely non-custodial application, meaning you are solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys to the digital asset wallets you hold. This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or liabilities may exist at law, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in this Agreement.</p>
        <p>Using the Protocol may require that you pay a fee, such as gas charges on the Blockchain to perform a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that Accelerator has no control over the functioning of the Blockchain nor over any transactions, the method of payment of any transactions, or any actual payments of transactions. You must ensure that you have a sufficient balance to complete any transaction on the Protocol before initiating such transaction. We do not have the ability to reverse or refund any mounts paid in error.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>6. Duties of the User</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree to comply with all applicable domestic and international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations applicable to your use of the Interface. You accept that it is your responsibility to assess whether the use of the Interface is lawful in your jurisdiction. Even if this Interface is accessible in your geographic area, the activities and services accessible on the Interface are not specifically directed in your country and Accelerator is not accountable for your respect of applicable legal requirements, as indicated below.</p>
        <p>As a condition to accessing or using the Interface, you:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>will only use the Services and the Interface for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms;</li>
          <li>will ensure that all information that you provide on the Interface is current, complete, and accurate;</li>
          <li>will maintain the security and confidentiality of access to your cryptographic private keys to the digital asset wallets you hold.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You further acknowledge and agree to exercise diligence against any type of fraudulent behavior or fake information put in place by third parties in connection to the Protocol, aiming to circumvent you and/or steal your funds. Accelerator will not be responsible for any loss that could arise from the described situations, which cannot be considered under its control. Please report any kind of fraud or circumvention to <a href="mailto:qacc-legal@giveth.io">qacc-legal@giveth.io</a>
        </p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>7. Prohibited Activities</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>You agree not to engage in, or attempt to engage in, any of the following categories of prohibited activity in relation to your access and use of the Interface:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>Intellectual Property Infringement. Activity that infringes on or violates any copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, right of publicity, right of privacy, or other proprietary or intellectual property rights under the law;</li>
          <li>Violation of any relevant and applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and any relevant and applicable privacy and data collection laws;</li>
          <li>Cyber attack. Activity that seeks to interfere with or compromise the integrity, security, or proper functioning of any computer, server, network, personal device, or other information technology system, including (but not limited to) the deployment of viruses and denial of service attacks;</li>
          <li>Fraud and Misrepresentation. Activity that seeks to defraud us or any other person or entity, including (but not limited to) providing any false, inaccurate, or misleading information in order to unlawfully obtain the property of another;</li>
          <li>Market Manipulation. Activity that violates any applicable law, rule, or regulation concerning the integrity of trading markets, including (but not limited to) the manipulative tactics commonly known as spoofing and wash trading;</li>
          <li>Harm of other users. Use the Interface in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Interface or the Protocol, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Interface or the Protocol in any manner;</li>
          <li>Any Other Unlawful Conduct. Activity that violates any applicable law, rule, or regulation of any relevant jurisdiction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>8. Assumption of Risk</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you are financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), fantom (FTM), Polygon (POL), and other digital assets such as those following the Ethereum Token Standard (ERC-20). In particular, you understand that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible.</p>
        <p>In providing information about tokens, the Interface associates or presumes the association of a token name, symbol or logo with a specific smart contract deployed to one or more Blockchain. In making such associations, the Interface relies upon third-party resources which may not be accurate or may not conform to your given expectations. Multiple smart contracts can utilize the same token name or token symbol as one another, meaning that the name or symbol of a token does not guarantee that it is the token desired by the User or generally associated with such name or symbol. You must not rely on the name, symbol or branding of a token on the Interface, but instead must examine the specific smart contract associated with the name, symbol or branding and confirm that the token accords with your expectations.</p>
        <p>You further understand that the markets for these digital assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to the Protocol through the Interface.</p>
        <p>In the light of the above, you further acknowledge that the Interface and your use of the Interface involves certain risks, including without limitation the following risks:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>That any Smart Contracts you interact with are entirely your own responsibility and liability, and that Accelerator is not party to the Smart Contracts;</li>
          <li>At any time, your access to your Digital assets may be suspended or terminated or there may be a delay in your access or use of your Digital assets which may result in the Digital assets diminishing in value or you being unable to execute a Smart Contract;</li>
          <li>If you are a borrower of Digital assets and if your collateral declines such that your collateral is no longer sufficient to secure your borrowed Digital assets, other users may seize your collateral to close out your borrowed Digital asset balance;</li>
          <li>There may be technical problems, cyber attacks or other events which can determine the malfunctioning of the Protocol and amount in the definitive loss of your funds;</li>
          <li>And the Interface and/or the Protocol may be suspended or terminated for any or no reason, which may limit your access to your Digital assets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Accordingly, you expressly agree that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not own or control the Protocol, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Interface. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Interface to interact with the Protocol. You further expressly waive and release Accelerator from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way related to your use of the Interface or the Smart Contracts.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>9. Third-Party Links</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>The Interface may contain hyperlinks or references to third party websites. Any such hyperlinks or references are provided for your information and convenience only. We have no control over third party websites and accept no legal responsibility for any content, material or information contained in them. The display of any hyperlink and reference to any third-party website does not mean that we endorse that third party&#x27;s website, products or services. Your use of a third-party site may be governed by the terms and conditions of that third-party site.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>10. Intellectual Property Rights</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>We are the owner of all intellectual property rights in the Interface and the material published on them. These works are protected by copyright laws and all such rights are reserved.</p>
        <p>You agree not to monitor, use or copy our web pages without our prior consent. Any unauthorized use or reproduction may be prosecuted.</p>
        <p>You will retain ownership of all copyright in data you upload or submit to the Interface. You grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, copy, distribute or publish and send this data in any manner.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>11. Non-Solicitation; No Investment Advice</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>You agree and understand that all the transactions that you submit through the Interface are considered unsolicited, which means that you have not received any investment advice from us in connection with any trades and that we do not conduct a suitability review of any trades you submit.</p>
        <p>All information provided by the Interface is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice. You should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information contained in the Interface. We do not make any investment recommendations to you or opine on the merits of any transaction or opportunity. You alone are responsible for determining whether any transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances, and risk tolerance. Nothing included in the Interface constitutes an offer or solicitation to sell, or distribution of, investments and related services to anyone in any jurisdiction. We recommend that you seek independent advice from financial advisory before making any such decision.</p>
        <p>From time to time, reference may be made to data we have gathered. These references may be selective or, may be partial. As markets change continuously, previously published information and data may not be current and should not be relied upon.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>12. Disclaimers</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>The Interface is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim any representations and warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including (but not limited to) the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Interface is at your own risk. We do not represent or warrant that access to the Interface will be continuous, uninterrupted, timely, or secure; that the information contained in the Interface will be accurate, reliable, complete, or current; or that the Interface will be free from errors, defects, viruses, or other harmful elements. No advice, information, or statement that we make should be treated as creating any warranty concerning the Interface. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any advertisements, offers, or statements made by third parties concerning the Interface.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Interface to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we so desire and/or to terminate your access to and use of the Interface, at any time and in our sole discretion. We may suspend or disable your access to the Interface if we consider it reasonable to do so, e.g. if you breach these Terms.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable to you for any loss or damage you may suffer as a result of the Interface being unavailable at any time for any reason.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>13. No Warranties</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>We do not guarantee that the Interface will be secure or free from bugs or viruses. You are responsible for configuring your information technology, computer programs and platform in order to access the Interface. You should use your own virus protection software. We do not guarantee that the use of the Interface, or any content taken from the Interface, will not infringe the rights of any third party.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>14. Indemnity</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, and subsidiaries from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from: (a) your access and use of the Interface; (b) your violation of any term or condition of this Agreement, the right of any third party, or any other applicable law, rule, or regulation; and (c) any other party&#x27;s access and use of the Interface with your assistance or using any device or account that you own or control.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>15. Limitation of Liability</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible property, arising out of or relating to any access or use of the Interface, nor will we be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Interface or the information contained within it. We assume no liability or responsibility for any: (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from any access or use of the Interface; (c) unauthorized access or use of any secure server or database in our control, or the use of any information or data stored therein; (d) interruption or cessation of function related to the Interface; (e) bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through the Interface; (f) errors or omissions in, or loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of, any content made available through the Interface; and (g) the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party. Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to us in exchange for access to and use of the Interface, or 3,000 (three thousand) USD, whichever is greater. This limitation of liability applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, and even if we have been advised of the possibility of such liability. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some of the disclaimers and limitations set forth in this Agreement may not apply to you. This limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>16. Assignments</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>We may perform any of our obligations, and exercise any of the rights granted to us under these Terms, through a third-party. We may assign any or all our rights and obligations under these Terms to any third-party.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>17. Severability</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>If any clause or part of any clause of these Terms is found to be void, unenforceable or invalid, then it will be severed from these Terms, leaving the remainder in full force and effect, provided that the severance has not altered the basic nature of these Terms.</p>
        <p>No single or partial exercise, or failure or delay in exercising any right, power or remedy by us shall constitute a waiver by us of, or impair or preclude any further exercise of, that or any right, power or remedy arising under these terms and conditions or otherwise.</p>
        <p>If any of the provisions in these Terms are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
        <p>All disclaimers, indemnities and exclusions in these Terms shall survive termination of the Terms and shall continue to apply during any suspension or any period during which the Interface is not available for you to use for any reason whatsoever.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>18. Governing law; Dispute Resolution</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p><em>Governing Law</em>. These Terms shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the British Virgin Islands (irrespective of the choice of laws principles) as to all matters, including matters of validity, construction, effect, enforceability, performance and remedies. Although the Site may be available in other jurisdictions, each User hereby acknowledges and agrees that such availability shall not be deemed to give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction over the Interface operator in any forum outside the British Virgin Islands.</p>
        <p><em>Settlement Negotiations</em>. If you have a potential legal dispute, claim or cause of action against Interface operator, you shall first (prior to initiating any litigation proceedings) contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:qacc-legal@giveth.io">qacc-legal@giveth.io</a> describing the nature of the potential dispute, claim or cause of action and providing all relevant documentation and evidence thereof. If so elected by us, you shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a settlement of any such legal dispute, claim or cause of action within 60 days of the delivery of such email. Any such dispute, claim or cause of action that is not finally resolved by a binding, written settlement agreement within such 60 days shall be brought and resolved exclusively in accordance with the following provisions.</p>
        <p><em>Mandatory Binding Arbitration</em>. All claims, disputes and controversies directly or indirectly arising out of or in connection with or directly or indirectly relating to these Terms or any of the matters or transactions contemplated by these Terms (for the avoidance of doubt, including any claim seeking to invalidate, or alleging that, all or any part of these Terms is unenforceable, void or voidable) (such claims, disputes and controversies, collectively, “Disputes”) shall be resolved by confidential, binding arbitration to be seated in London and conducted in the English language pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the London Chamber of Arbitration and Mediation (the “Rules”). The arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the procedures set out in the Rules. The award or decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties and the parties expressly waive any right under the laws of any jurisdiction to appeal or otherwise challenge the award, ruling or decision of the arbitrator. The judgment of any award or decision may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to the extent necessary.</p>
        <p><em>Waiver of Jury Trial</em>. The parties hereby acknowledge, represent and warrant that they understand that: (i) there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and, absent this mandatory provision, the parties would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial concerning Disputes; (ii) in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation; (iii) the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court; and (iv) court review of an arbitration award is limited. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the transactions contemplated hereby.</p>
        <p><em>Confidentiality of Arbitration</em>. Except to the extent necessary to enforce their respective rights under these Terms or as otherwise required by applicable law, the parties undertake to maintain confidentiality as to the existence and events of the arbitration proceedings and as to all submissions, correspondence and evidence relating to the arbitration proceedings. This provision shall survive the termination of the arbitral proceedings.</p>
        <p><em>Court Jurisdiction</em>. To the extent that any court is required to weigh on the enforceability of Section 18, to enforce any judgment of the arbitrator, then, without limiting Section 18 or any other provision of this Agreement, you (A) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the British Virgin Islands for such purpose; (B) agree not to commence any suit, action or other proceeding arising in connection with or based upon this instrument or the matters contemplated by this instrument except before the courts of the British Virgin Islands, and (C) hereby waives, and agree not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any such suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper or that this instrument or the subject matter hereof or thereof may not be enforced in or by such court.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>19. Waivers</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>With respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the Interface for personal, commercial or other purposes, all disputes, controversies or claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action or other representative proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims. You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Accelerator are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action, collective action, or other representative proceeding of any kind.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>20. Entire Agreement</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>These Terms and the documents referred to in them set out the entire agreement between you and us with respect to your use of the Interface, Accelerator and the functionalities provided via the Interface and supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous representations, communications or agreements (written or oral) made between you or us.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
